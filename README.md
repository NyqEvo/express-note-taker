# Express Note Taker

## Description 

This project is a simple and easy to use note taker that works in the browser. It uses express as well as fs middleware to adjust or store data stored in a json file and display that data on the site for the user. This project was made to give users access to a very simple way to take notes that is also stored in a very simple way as well. During this project I was able to demonstrate my ability to route properly in the backend to have requests on the front end fulfilled without issue.
